Given the data from The Word Bank:
<br>
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?end=2019&start=1960&view=chart
<br>
do animated bar plots (gif file) for all years for:
<br>
* 5 most populated countries (filter out groups like South Asia, OECD, etc.) (a)
*  pick one country and year at random and then find 4 other countries that are the closest by 
population size (either + or -) in given year and do similar plot (e.g., Chile at 1985 and 4 other countries) (b)
* the same as (b) but this time use Poland as "the centroid" (c)
<br>
The report should be made in HTML. Plus three plots and 
three python scripts should be added to the project folder.
